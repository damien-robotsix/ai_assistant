The `squash_and_pr.sh` script reads the commit message directly from the `/tmp/assistant_output.txt` file and uses it for both the commit and the pull request title. Here's the potential issue:

1. **Commit Message Handling**: The commit message is set through `git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"`. If the `COMMIT_MESSAGE` includes special characters like backticks (`) and newlines (`\n`), they may not be correctly interpreted or may interfere with the command processing, as the shell may misinterpret these characters.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - **Escape Characters**: Ensure that special characters are properly escaped or replaced before being passed to `git commit`. This can be done by sanitizing the `COMMIT_MESSAGE`.
   - **Using a Temporary File**: Instead of using `-m`, you can use `-F` with a temporary file if the commit message is complex or contains special characters. This avoids issues with character escaping.
   - **Review Assistant Output**: Check how the assistant constructs the message. It might be useful to adjust how text is formatted or parsed in the assistant itself to accommodate commit message constraints.

Should we proceed to modify and test these recommendations in the script, or do you have specific changes in mind?
